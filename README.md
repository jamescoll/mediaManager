mediaManager

Draft Edition

This is an application which will run as a web service and provide a useful interface into a collection of media.

This first draft will contain a file system scanner and a wiki page scanner. 

This is a personal project whose goal is to provide a better interface via a browser or chromecast to my media collection.

Technologies used in first draft are:

Java, MySQL, jsoup, maven.

To use this code simply download what's here, import it into an IDE of your choice as a maven project, create a db with the tables outlined in tablemap.sql and you're good to go.
